# ProjectsPythonUdemy

This repository is dedicated to the Python projects that I will be completing during my Udemy course. Each project aims to enhance my understanding of Python programming, focusing on practical applications and problem-solving skills. The code will be organized into separate folders

## Projects Structure

The structure of each project will vary depending on the requirements, but the following is an example structure for the first mini-project:

- **project1.py**: Main file for the first mini-project.
- **app1_map/**: Directory for the first app project, containing the following files:
  - `hospitales.txt`: A text file with information about hospitals, including coordinates and whether they have a helipad.
  - `world.json`: A JSON file with world population data.
  - `map_app1.py`: The Python code for generating the map application.
  - `Map1.html`: The HTML file where the map is displayed.

## Projects
1. **Concatenate sentences**: 
   -  In this project we ask the user to input the sentences they want
   - Based on the sentences, if we detect that is a question (What, Why, How), we add the question mark (if not a point)
   - After the user has finished the input of sentences, it will print a paragraph with all the sentences

2. **Map of Hospitals in Madrid**: 
   - I have added some hospitals in Madrid and included the information regarding it having a heliport
   - Those who have a heliport will be marked in color blue
   - Added a feature to show each country in a different color based on the population it had (the population is extracted froma json file)
   - With this project, I have learnt how to use folium, add markers, read from txt files with pandas as a csv, read from json, stylize the markers and population information

More projects will be added as the course progresses.
